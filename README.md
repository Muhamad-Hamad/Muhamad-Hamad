ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @Muhamad-Hamad, but you can call me Hamadi. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently on an exciting learning journey, exploring the realms of Flutter and databases. As someone who's relatively new to coding, I'm eagerly soaking up knowledge and honing my skills in these areas.

ðŸš€ Why Flutter? The idea of building beautiful, native mobile applications with a single codebase fascinated me. I'm thrilled to be diving deep into the Flutter framework, experimenting with UI designs, and crafting delightful user experiences.

ðŸ’¾ When it comes to databases, I'm exploring the intricacies of storing, retrieving, and managing data. Understanding how databases work is crucial for building robust applications, and I'm eager to master this aspect of software development.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
